# ML_in_Health_Club
Welcome to the repository for Machine Learning Packages/tools/models for healthcare. As we cover papers in the meetings, we will add relevant information to this page. We will reorganize this repository later. For now, welcome aboard!


#Reference for Tools and Packages:

1) For Standard Machine Learning models (i.e. Custom optimization methods per model)
Both for Supervised Learning/Unsupervised Learning
Recommended Tool: 
SKLearn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) 
Requirements: Python (also numpy, scipy, matplotlib)


2) For Deep Learning (i.e. Back-propagation based optimization for any method)
	Both for Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
	Recommended Tools: 
TensorFlow ( https://www.tensorflow.org/ is in Python); Developed/Maintained by Google
Torch (pytorch http://pytorch.org/ is in Python - torch http://torch.ch/  is in Lua language); Developed/Maintained by Facebook AI research and NYU
